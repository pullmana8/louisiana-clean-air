<h1>Louisiana Clean Air</h1>
<h2>Better Air, Healthier Life</h2>

<b>Description</b>

<p>
This is the current news site, where we can provide updates on our progress. Each of the post will demonstrate the update from what we have achieved, and as well as what we are focusing on to improve our services to you.
</p>

<p>
Currently, we are under development to create a blog as well as an e-commerce style website to showcase the HYLA products.
</p>

<p>
However, it has been a journey, especially when we have a road plan of what we would like to do in the future.
</p>

<b>A further note about Louisiana Clean Air</b>
<p>
  <i>What is a better way to have clean air in your home?</i>
</p>
<p>I am sure you have asked yourself this question, especially when you have a family that you are taking care of, and you want to make sure that your children are healthy.
</p>

<b>Contact us!</b>
<p>Contact one of us, [Tee](thamarsai.caldwell@louisianaca.com) or [Antonette](antonette.caldwell@louisianaca.com) for more information regarding these products.</p>


<b>Location</b>
<p>
We have a current location in Shreveport, LA located on North Market. However, to better showcase these products, we are going to open up another location in roughly 6 months to 1 year time frame. The reason is, we would like to help our current customers and future customers learn more about our products in person.
</p>

<h3>Path to Completion</h3>
1. Showcase products in gallery (add gallery page, and pictures)
2. Develop a system to schedule appointments easily through embedded calendar
3. Text message bot to be able to reschedule appointments if needed
4. Open second location for showcase of products in person
