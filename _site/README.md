### Louisiana Clean Air
#### Better Air, Healthier Life

What is a better way to have clean air in your home?

Currently, we are under development to create a blog as well as an e-commerce style website to showcase the HYLA products.

However, it has been a journey, especially when we have a road plan of what we would like to do in the future.

We have a current location in Shreveport, LA located on North Market. However, to better showcase these products, we are going to open up another location in roughly 6 months to 1 year time frame. The reason is, we would like to help our current customers and future customers learn more about our products in person.

Contact one of us, [Tee](thamarsai.caldwell@louisianaca.com) or [Antonette](antonette.caldwell@louisianaca.com) for more information regarding these products.
