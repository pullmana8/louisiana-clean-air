Experience the new EST version of the HYLA product, which is the clean air system. This clean air system is an air purifier, designed to take in the dust, allergen, gasses, and mites during normal cleaning. It cleans the air with the help of the water filter. It does not use the filter bag that you normally see in the other traditional vacuum cleaner. It can be used as an air purifier alone, or you can use it in conjunction with the vacuum part to vacuum.
